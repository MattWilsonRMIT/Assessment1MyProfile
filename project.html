											<p>Focus On More Than Just Food</p>
										</header>
										<p>Imagine you are about to go grocery shopping but you have no idea where to even start 
										   because your partner cannot eat gluten and requires iron-rich meals, your eldest is vegetarian and lactose intollerant
										   and you are trying to cut back on carbs while attempting to cater for everyone elses needs and still enjoy your food.
										   The first and most obvious thought is that you need to virtually need to shop for three people individually.</br></br>
										   
										   What if there was a different way to organize meals for multiple people (or yourself) all with different dietary requirements?</br></br>
										   
										   This application will endevour to allow users to easily generate recipes and meal plans for any number of days based on dietary requirements,
										   weight goals and gym goals. Functionality will enable the app to produce a shopping list that will automatically generate based on the users 
										   selected supermarket and then input that list into the online ordering portion of the supermarkets website.
										   </br></br>
                                           
										   As a father who has some fairly strict dietary requirements and a desire to try and eat healthy</br>
										   along with a young son who needs a large variety of different food to help his growth and developement, I believe there is a gap in</br>
										   the market. When it comes to easily meeting the "food needs" of a family or yourself this is especially true with busy lives involving work,
										   hobbies and family.</br> Services like "Hello Fresh" and "Dinnerly" seek to streamline the process of finding a recipe, grocery shopping, 
										   food preperation and cooking. They do succeed with making this easier but they do not allow for a lot of variation to meet different needs within
										   a single order and (at least for me peronsally) these are not financially lucrative for a whole family.</br></br>
										   This application seeks to take food from an idea to your plate using local super markets and good old fasioned family cooking combined with
										   industry knowledge to bring you something affordable, delicious and healthy that you have tailor made for your situation.</br></br>
