										<p>You are to write a report of around 1000 words describing your project idea. You
                                           should describe the project itself, as well as why you think it is important or
                                           interesting, and any potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
                                           What are you passionate about? What kind of IT innovation would you like to see?
                                           What project will help you develop the skills, experience and knowledge required to
                                           make you qualified for your ideal job?You need not have full answers to any of these questions, but you are required to
                                           have some ideas about an IT project that you think will address at least one of these
                                           questions. It may not be possible to find one that answers all three, but it is quite
                                           likely that something you would find interesting or useful will have a similar effect on
                                           others.</br>
                                           There are a number of possible types of projects that you may consider. Some
                                           potential ideas are below; others will be discussed in the following weeks.
                                           Developing a game using tools such as Unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d.
                                           Developing a smartphone app, using whatever programming language in which you
                                           have expertise, or by using tools such as MIT App Inventor.
                                           Finding an innovative application for new hardware developments, such as
                                           Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys, small robots or related technologies.
                                           Creating a FAQ and implementing it as a chatterbot, possibly involving speech-to-text
                                           and text-to-speech software.</br>
                                           Building an electronic artefact such as a model for Minecraft or similar games, along
                                           the lines of the United Nations Block by Block project.
                                           For this assignment, you need to write approximately 1,000 words about your project
                                           idea.</br>
                                           This should not only describe what the project would be, but also why you think it is
                                           important or interesting, and what potential drawbacks or obstacles you anticipate.
                                           Your description should include the following sections. The word counts below are
                                           recommendations only not absolutes but are a good guide. </br></br>
                                           
										   Overview (100 words) - Imagine you are about to go grocery shopping but you have no idea where to even start 
										   because your partner cannot eat gluten and requires iron-rich meals, your eldest is vegetarian and lactose intollerant
										   and you are trying to cut back on carbs while attempting to cater for everyone elses needs and still enjoy your food.
										   The first and most obvious thought is that you need to virtually need to shop for three people individually.</br></br>
										   
										   What if there was a different way to organize meals for multiple people (or yourself) all with different dietary requirements?</br></br>
										   
										   This application will endevour to allow users to easily generate recipes and meal plans for any number of days based on dietary requirements,
										   weight goals and gym goals. Functionality will enable the app to produce a shopping list that will automatically generate based on the users 
										   selected supermarket and then input that list into the online ordering portion of the supermarkets website.
										   </br></br>
                                           
										   Motivation (100) words) - As a father who has some fairly strict dietary requirements and a desire to try and eat healthy</br>
										   along with a young son who needs a large variety of different food to help his growth and developement, I believe there is a gap in</br>
										   the market. When it comes to easily meeting the "food needs" of a family or yourself this is especially true with busy lives involving work,
										   hobbies and family.</br> Services like "Hello Fresh" and "Dinnerly" seek to streamline the process of finding a recipe, grocery shopping, 
										   food preperation and cooking. They do succeed with making this easier but they do not allow for a lot of variation to meet different needs within
										   a single order and (at least for me peronsally) these are not financially lucrative for a whole family.</br></br>
										   This application seeks to take food from an idea to your plate using local super markets and good old fasioned family cooking combined with
										   industry knowledge to bring you something affordable, delicious and healthy that you have tailor made for your situation.</br></br>

                                           Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or
                                           service.</BR></BR>

                                           Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or 
                                           Page 7 of 11
                                           other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.</br></br>
										   
                                           Skills Required(100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including
                                           software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it
                                           be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</br></br>
                                          
										  Outcome(100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How
                                          will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?<p>
