											<h1>My journey into IT<br />
											</h1>
											<p>How IT has deinfed me, the good and the bad...</p>
										</header>
											<img align="right" class="interestimg" src="images/journey.jpeg"/><p> I grew up in (what was then) a tiny costal town, Hervey Bay. There were no gutters on the streets and there were trees and ocean	on all sides. Fishing, Tourism and Construction were the big industries and as a result, a career revolving around communication or techonology was never something offered to me.</br>
										It wasn't until my brother brought home the first Windows PC I had ever seen and connected it to the "internet" that I realised "this is what I want to do." At the time I didn't actually understand the scope of this new technology and the avenues it would later open for not just myself, but the world. </br></br>
										Dial-Up internet was the most incredible thing I had ever experienced. Sure, video games were the primary reason my brother brought this incredible technology into our house, and yes, that was absolutely the gate-way that led to me writing this article for you, but it was the seemingly limitless knowledge we now had access to that truly captivated me.
	                                    Sadly, this passion and the drive to foster it into a career wouldn't manifest itself for some time, and this is where the good, the bad and the ugly surrounding IT would slowly present themselves to me over the next decade.</br></br>

	                                    I would work in retail selling video games, move onto a career as a qualified butcher, leave that to clean toilets and experience a failed marriage before realising my addiction to video games and my wifes addiction to social media had diverted us from not just each other, but our individual and professional potential.</br></br>

	                                    My big break came in the form of a position with a local government, managing and assisting with the maintenance and structure of their metro-level CCTV network.
	                                    It was here that my supervisor would assign me a task that would change the trajectory of the rest of my professional life.</br>
	                                    The problem was simple in essence, upon sign in, push an image of the person to a dashboard. I did not even know where to start, but I took this on and spend the next few weeks learning and researching.</br>
	                                    The hundreds of hours I spent learning various languages of code and the fulfillment I would experience as one problem after another was solved became addictive. But this wasn't like video-games, this was not only productive but I was providing people with a solution.</br></br>

	                                    Suddenly IT and it's purpose and place, at least for me personally, became clear. It is about giving people a way to connect and interact when there was not previously a means to do so through innovation and creativity.</br></br>

	                                    So here we are, together, me writing and you reading through the incredible means IT has provided us both.</p>
